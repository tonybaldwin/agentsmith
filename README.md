Agent Smith is not a bad man, once you get to know him.

Agent Smith is here to help you.

Agent Smith can help you with bbcode, and control your xposting, and much more.

Agent Smith is a crossplatform client for the [RedMatrix](https://redmatrix.me).

Agent Smith is very flexible. He can even change colors.

It's okay, Mr. Anderson. Agent Smith is here.

Take the RED pill.

DEPENDENCIES:

Agent Smith requires:
* Tcl8.5
* Tk8.5, and
* tcllib (for http, tls, and base64)
* in Debian and some others, tcl-tls is a separate pkg. Install it.

It also requires that you [Get Zot](http://getzot.com), of course.

(see https://redmatrix.me )

Most modern Linux OSes and *BSDs usually already have tcl, although you may have to install it with your favorite package manager.  (yum, apt, pacman, whatever).

For windows and other OSes, go to http://www.activestate.com/activetcl to get tcl.
